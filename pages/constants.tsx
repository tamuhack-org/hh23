    question: 'Who can attend?',
    answer: 'Any Texas A&M graduate / undergraduate student who is at least 18. Regardless of your experience, education, or background, as long as you are excited about learning, building, and having fun, we\'d love for you to attend.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much experience do I need?',
    answer: 'Absolutely zero! We want you here because you have a passion for creating, not because you\'re the most experienced hacker on the block. We\'ll have lots of resources including workshops and a bunch of mentors to help beginners get started. There\'ll also be plenty of people to learn from and help out!',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much does it cost?',
    answer: 'Nothing. Nada. Zilch. It\'s completely free for all accepted hackers. To make it even better, we\'ll be giving out a ton of swag to every in-person hacker, and prizes to our winners.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What should I bring?',
    answer: 'Please bring a valid student ID in addition to anything that would help you with creating your hack or making you comfortable. Don\'t bring anything you wouldn\'t bring on an airplane.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do teams work?',
    answer: 'Teams are limited to 4 hackers. You don\'t need to have a team before the event or have one at all, but hacking with friends is more fun! There will be plenty of time after the opening ceremony to form teams if you don\'t have one yet.',
